### Version 1.0

### Introduction to tool principles

Use the **Http.sys** driver to operate urlacl. Since Http.sys is the basis of the IIS server, its priority is higher than that of IIS. It will not cause port bind conflicts and achieve the port taking effect. Since it is related to the external service port of the victim machine Similarly, it can achieve extremely high concealment. Because its effect after taking effect is very similar to the Joker in LOL, it was named Joker.

### Instructions

**The prerequisite for using this tool is the IIS environment with administrator rights**

#### 1. Reuse based on path

~~~powershell
Joker.exe "http://*:{PORT}/{PATH}"
~~~

**In this way, when port 80 is accessed normally, it is a normal business, and when port 80 is accessed with a special header, it is a backdoor program. **
